    Water is a main component of saliva. Saliva also includes small amounts of electrolytes, mucus, and enzymes. Itâ€™s essential for breaking down solid food and keeping your mouth healthy.

Your body generally produces enough saliva with regular fluid intake. However, your saliva production may decrease as a result of age or certain medications or therapies.
